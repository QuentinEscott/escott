I thought it would be apt for my first SCCM post to discuss the first Microsoft KB that the team and I created. It was [KB4465865](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4465865/software-updates-do-not-download-in-configmgr-if-wsus-is-disconnected). We were up to date with our SCCM install (Current Branch 1806), so we could get the Microsoft engineering team to make a hotfix for us. It took many hours on the phone.
